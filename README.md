A scientific calculator still in development. Basic features unavailable includes;

1. Degree value of sine, cosine and tangent are not accurate.
2. Evaluation without operators (e.g 5cos2).

Kindly point out other bugs if found (there's definitely a whole colonyðŸ˜…).
I'd totally welcome help adding the above lacking features and new features.
